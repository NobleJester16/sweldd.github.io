Group 5 Git repo

Assessment 2 Team Project. Some information relevant to the tasks need to be done using GitHub

Purpose

Now that you have developed a profile of yourself (Assignment 1), it is time to use this profile to assemble a group, and to show how you can work as a team to produce a report on various aspects of the IT industry.

What you will demonstrate:

You’ll demonstrate your ability to work in a team environment, complete research tasks, and to present information in a professional report format. You’ll also explore your creative side by putting forward a group project idea expanding or combining project ideas from Assignment 1 which can be bolstered by your research into your chosen IT Technologies.

How you will demonstrate it:

Writing up a document covering all of the different areas listed above (and detailed below), to be then formatted and presented in a PDF Report. Present a group website hosted on GitHub Pages.

Specifications

Team profile

Each of you will have produced a personal profile for Assignment 1. You are to assemble this information, reviewing it as you see fit given your feedback from Assignment 1, to produce a team profile. This should be organised into the following subsections.

Team Name

You are free to choose any name for your group that you wish. However, this name will be used to identify your group for the rest of the course, so please choose wisely. You should also keep in mind that this name could be one that comes to the attention of potential employers.

Personal information

One paragraph per person, including name, student number, background, hobbies, IT interest and IT experience. This should also include your team’s chosen name.

Team Profile

The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to reflect on how well the group has worked later.

Ideal Jobs

Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback from Assignment 1. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?

Tools

Having set up an individual website in Assignment 1, you should now set up a group website, using the same approach. You should then include links to each individual website on the group website.
You also need to set up a GitHub or similar repository for your group on which you can use Git. This is to facilitate the production and maintenance of group artefacts, which will include the assignment submission, but may also include other reports or information, code, examples, formatted data, images and videos, links, and similar information.
You will also need to set up your group on Canvas.
In your report you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include the following:
• The link to your group’s website
• The link to your group’s Git repository (GitHub, BitBucket, etc)
• Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only be able to do this close to the time of submission.
